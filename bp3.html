	<h1>Man From the South Analysis</h1>
	<a href="bestprojects.html"><p>Back</p></a>
	<p2>The final and most recent project that I am most<br>
	proud about this year is my analysis of the short story<br>
	"Man From the South" by Roald Dahl for literary devices<br>
	and how they develop the theme of the story.  When I<br>
	first completed the assignment, it wasn't of the quality<br>
	that I wanted due to my lack of understanding about how<br>
	to properly analyze the text for literary devices, and I<br>
	recieved a less than satisfactory grade on it.  However,<br>
	when I got the assignment back I conferenced with Dr. Baum<br>
	about how I could improve the quality of my assignment and<br>
	properly analyze it.  I then revised my essay, putting a lot<br>
	of effort into it and working hard to make sure that my <br>
	analysis was far more satsifactory than before.  The hard work<br>
	paid off, as I recieved a much better revision score on it<br>
	which I am proud of, but I am even more proud of how much I <br>
	learned thanks to the assignment.<br></p2><br>
